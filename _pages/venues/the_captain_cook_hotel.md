description: An iconic student pub which closed in 2014 due to declining revenue. It was purchased by property developers in 2016 and renovated into a trendy restaurant until it closed again in 2017. Then in 2018 it was purchased by former <a href="/venues/chicks_hotel">Chicks Hotel</a> operator Mike McLoed and reopened as a music focused venue.
