The Panasonic G6 was the first camera I ever bought back in 2013. It was popular with people like me who wanted decent video quality but didn't want to fork out the extra for a more pro-oriented GH series camera such as the GH3. A few weeks ago I bought a G85 to replace it. Was it worth it?

Panasonic's Micro Four Thirds camera's are often considered "hybrid cameras" which are designed for both video and stills. This holds true for the most part, and compared to other similarly priced DSLRs Panasonics camera tend to offer more video focused features. Alongside full manual controls in video the G6 for example has a microphone input.

As someone who does both photography and videography the G6 seemed perfect to me. It served me well for a number of years and I only really had a few complaints:

* High ISO performance isn't great: Anything about ISO 1600 is barely usable.
* Handling is a little weird: Shutter speed, aperture, and especially focus adjustment feels laggy and the "rocker" style switch isn't a great replacement for a real dial.
* The SD card slot is in an annoying place

So why upgrade to the G85? To me the G85 is the first major update to Panasonics budget line since the G6. The G7 was more of an incremental upgrade, improving the handling slightly and adding 4k video. The G85 adds in-body stabilisation which is a game changer, and enough to feel like it's worth upgrading.

## Handling

The handling is vastly improved. Gone is the is the lag in the menu's, the time it takes to turn on is roughly halfed and everything feels much snappier in use.

The body is chunkier and nicer to hold. There are two dedicated dials now, one of which has a button on it to switch it's function. This means I can have shutter speed and aperture at my fingertips, and ISO not far off. There's a dedicated drive mode dial which I'm not too bothered about, I'd prefer a dedicated ISO dial to be honest. The SD card has a dedicated flap on the side now too, which is nice.

There were also numerous other little improvements to the design. The sensor which detects your eye and turns on the EVF is now above the viewfinder instead of below so you're less likely to accidentally trigger it when operating the touchscreen. The buttons on the back have been moved so they're stacked vertically instead of horizontally so you're less likely to accidentally trigger something with your palm. These are all things which I didn't know I wanted, but now that I've got them operating the G6 feels clunky and error prone.

## Image quality

### Sharpness

Sharpness is improved fairly significantly. These are JPEGs straight out of the camera using the standard colour profile with my Panasonic 25mm 1.7. As you can see overall color rendering is different, it tends to auto white balance a little differently and expose slightly brighter.

{% include blog_image.html src="g85_sharpness.JPG" description="G85 ISO800 F1.7" %}

The difference in sharpnes is more obvious when you really start pixel peeping.

{% include blog_image.html src="g85_sharpness_2_100.JPG" description="G85" %}

### High ISO

It's also quite a bit cleaner at high ISOs.

{% include blog_image.html src="g85_1600.JPG" description="G85 ISO1600" %}

{% include blog_image.html src="g6_1600_100.JPG" description="G6 ISO1600 Crop" %}
{% include blog_image.html src="g85_1600_100.JPG" description="G85 ISO1600 Crop" %}

I would say this is point that the G6 becomes unusable, but the G85 is clean enough in a pinch.

{% include blog_image.html src="g6_3200.JPG" description="G6 ISO3200" %}
{% include blog_image.html src="g85_3200.JPG" description="G85 ISO3200" %}

{% include blog_image.html src="g6_3200_100.JPG" description="G6 ISO3200 Crop" %}
{% include blog_image.html src="g85_3200_100.JPG" description="G85 ISO3200 Crop" %}

At this point the image really begins to break down in both cameras.

{% include blog_image.html src="g6_6400.JPG" description="G6 ISO6400" %}
{% include blog_image.html src="g85_6400.JPG" description="G85 ISO6400" %}

{% include blog_image.html src="g6_6400_100.JPG" description="G6 ISO6400 Crop" %}
{% include blog_image.html src="g85_6400_100.JPG" description="G85 ISO6400 Crop" %}

This is really pushing it, I don't think I'll ever need to go up to 12800 but it's interesting to see how much better the G85 handles it.

{% include blog_image.html src="g6_12800.JPG" description="G6 ISO12800" %}
{% include blog_image.html src="g85_12800.JPG" description="G85 ISO12800" %}

{% include blog_image.html src="g85_12800_100.JPG" description="G85 ISO12800 Crop" %}

And just for reference this is what an image at ISO25600 looks like on the G85:

## Colours

The Cinema D and Cinema V colour profiles are welcome additions. Cinema D gives you a flatter image which is good for grading (to be honest it's fine straight out of the camera too) and V gives a more dynamic image. They've also added highlight controls so you can bring up the shadows or whatever, but I've found this introduces too much noise.

## Autofocus

## Stabilisation

Stabilisation is just awesome. I shoot mostly handheld, so I'm used to handheld 'jitters' in my videos no matter how still I try to hold it. The in body stabilisation takes away those jitters. It still looks handheld but it's much easier to watch. There's also the option of electronic stabilisation which crops the video and bins pixels in realtime to make it even smoother, but to me this looks a little too smooth and artificial.

## 4k

I haven't been able to test 4K video yet because my SD card isn't fast enough. I'm hoping that 4k video will mean a better noise profile, so even if I end up downscaling it to 1080p the footage looks nicer.

It would be nice if Panasonic had allowed for higher bitrates in 1080p. 28mbps at 50fps is just a tad low, but I guess they want to encourage pro users to get the GH5 which allows for 200mbps video.

## Conclusion

Does it address my issue with the G6? Not completely. High ISO performance is still pretty bad, as is typical for micro four thirds cameras, but things are definitely improved. The things which make it worth it to me are small things I didn't know I needed. The general feel of the camera, placement of buttons, dials, etc. In use it feels much quicker and I'm more confident I'll be able to get the shot.

Also it keeps many of the things which made the G6 great: The microphone port, HDMI out, a pretty good "intelligent auto" mode which manages to make pictures look decent without any effort.

 Overall I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, but it's a pretty difficult value proposition to someone who already has a G6. To be honest the sensible choice would be waiting until the next generation. That new GH5 sensor is bound to end up trickling down to the cheaper models soon enough, and that should provide much more tangible image quality benefits.

 If I were to start again today I'd probably buy Sony. Sony's been making huge improvements in video, their A6500 has similar if not better quality to a Panasonic plus the benefits of a bigger APS-C sensor and significantly faster autofocus. Switching camera mounts now would mean replacing all my lenses which would be expensive, so for now I'm sticking with Panasonic.
