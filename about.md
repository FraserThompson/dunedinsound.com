What is this?
--------------------------
The aim of dunedinsound.com is to document a slice of the current music scene in Dunedin as it happens.

Part of this involves going to gigs, documenting them via photo, video and audio, then archiving them here.

My recording rig is wearable, which means I can stand in the audience and get a pretty good recording without any setup required. Also unlike a recording from the soundboard my recordings capture exactly what it sounded like from the audience. The downside is not every element will be clear like a studio recording. Most of the recordings are [binaural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording) so that means they'll sound best on headphones.

I'm not affiliated with any venue or band so consider my recordings bootlegs.

### So far...

{% include metadata.html %}

* **{{global_gig_count}}** gigs
* **{{global_band_count}}** bands
* **{{global_photo_count}}** photos
* **{{global_video_count}}** videos
* **{{global_audio_count}}** audios

Why not just put stuff on Facebook like everyone else?
--------------------------
I don't think Facebook is designed for long term storage and the interface sucks.

dunedinsound.com is meant to be a more permanent archive, the goal is that artists/fans will be able to access it decades from now.

What equipment do you use?
---------------------------
* Panasonic G85 micro four-thirds camera with vintage M42 mount lenses, usually an Asahi Pentax 50mm 1.4 (the one with the radioactive element).
* Panasonic G6 as a b-cam for multi-angle video.
* Custom binaural headset: Two electret microphones shoved into a pair of earplugs and wired up to a battery box. They go in my ears.
* Roland R-05 portable recorder. Built in mics are okay as a backup.

Are you making money off this?
------------------------------
No, I do it because I enjoy doing it. There's literally zero monetization going on. No ads or sponsorship or anything.

It does cost money to host all this stuff. Currently that's only around $5 a month but it will grow as I document more gigs. If you want to help cover the cost then you can donate via PayPal:

If you're not making money then why do it?
------------------------------
Because I enjoy doing it and I think this little micro-community is worth documenting.

I've got something to say!
