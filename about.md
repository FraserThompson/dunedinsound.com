What is this?
--------------------------
I go to gigs in Dunedin, document them, then archive them here. I'm not affiliated with any venue or band so consider my recordings bootlegs.

My recording rig is wearable, which means I can stand in the audience and get a pretty good recording without any setup required. Also unlike a recording from the soundboard my recordings capture exactly what it sounded like from the audience. The downside is not every element will be clear like a studio recording.

Most of the recordings are [binaural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording) so that means they'll sound best on headphones.

Why not just put stuff on Facebook like everyone else?
--------------------------
I don't think Facebook is designed for long term storage, also the interface sucks and makes it impossible to find anything again. This is meant to be a more permanent archive, the idea being that artists/fans will be able to access it decades from now.

What equipment do you use?
---------------------------
* Panasonic G85 micro four-thirds camera with vintage M42 mount lenses, usually an Asahi Pentax 50mm 1.4 (the one with the radioactive element).
* Panasonic G6 as a b-cam for multi-angle video.
* Custom binaural headset: Two electret microphones shoved into a pair of earplugs and wired up to a battery box. They go in my ears.
* Roland R-05 portable recorder. Built in mics are okay as a backup.

Are you making money off this?
------------------------------
No, I do it because I enjoy doing it. 

It does cost money to host all this stuff, if you want to help pay for that then you can donate via PayPal:
