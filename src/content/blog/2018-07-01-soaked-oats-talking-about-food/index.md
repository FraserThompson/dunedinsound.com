**Dunedinsound: Your press release described you as a "southern stew of Kurt Vile, Mac DeMarco with a good shake of Kevin Morby". If you as a band were a real stew, what would be in it?**

Oscar: It'd have to be oats I guess.

**Dunedinsound: Oats in a stew?**

Oscar: Yeah it thickens it up.

Henry: Stringy meat. Like quite a reasonbly poor cut of meat, like a brisket. A good ale in there with it.

Oscar: An oat stout?

Henry: An oat stout.

Conor: Definitely some cask wine maybe?

Henry: Bit of red wine is good.

Conor: Onions is like the rythm section aye.

Henry: Onions and a couple of cans of tomatoes maybe.

**Dunedinsound: So you're saying your music is kind of nourishing but a bit kind of... cheap?**

Conor: Definitely cheap.

Oscar: And definitely not nourishing. After you've had it you'll feel like you've had a bit much.

**Dunedinsound: What's your ideal breakfast?**

Henry: Well it's not oats, we're not an oat band... No slip ups, the last EP we released late 2017, we spent time on the westcoast recording it, so every mornin we all had the same breakfast: Four weetbix, half tin of peaches, half banana, some honey drizzled on top, some yoghurt and milk. And that gets you through to like one or two o' clock, so warming, so filling.

**Dunedinsound: Not into Soaked Oats then?**

Oscar: Actually I had porridge this morning.

**Dunedinsound: Same. How do you cook your porridge?**

Oscar: Lot of milk... Soak the oats before you do it.

**Dunedinsound: Microwave?**

Oscar: On the stove. Cook it for a wee while, put some dates in there, put some banana in there, and deliver with a bit of brown sugar and cream.

Henry: See if I have oats I don't cook it into porride, I've always just preferred that to porridge. Yeah it's amazing, if you've got some chia seeds and put it in there it just goes wild.

Oscar: And sometimes just marmite on toast. Always a cup of tea.

**Dunedinsound: Not coffee?**

Henry: Too early for us, we normally caffeinate around 10 or 11am.

**Dunedinsound: Right on. Why are you doing this tour now?**

Oscar: We're going to America in September and we're doing it all ourselves, we're paying for that whole thing out of our pockets and it's probably going to be pretty grim. Which is part of the reason.

Henry: We also have quite a lot of stuff we're planning on releasing in the near future so when we booked this tour we kind of expected by this time we'd have a single out which we don't but we're going to play a lot of new material at the shows which is a great opportunity.

_At this point Danny Brady (Death and The Maiden) walks past_

Oscar: Oi if you were to describe Soaked Oats sound and put it in a stew...

Danny: Kind of putting me on the spot here. It would definitely be warm and creamy... There'd be a lot of cream in the middle.

_We return to the very serious interview..._

**So the first album felt very summery, and then the second was wintery, so the third one will be what?**

Oscar: Hopefully not attributable to one particular season.

Henry: ...but it will be muddy which can come about in any season I think? So maybe spring?
