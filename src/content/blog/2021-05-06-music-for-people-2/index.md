Way back in February of 2020, just before everything turned to custard, New New New hosted its largest lineup of acts to date. The event was called Music for People and featured 11 vastly different acts ranging from hip-hop, experimental noise, grunge, indie rock and more.

Now Music for People is about to receive its long overdue sequel, with double the venues, triple the music, and the same goal of putting an eclectic mix in front of an audience. This time though the context behind the event is completely different.

Event organizer and musician Person Will explains.

“It started [as the result of] a back and forth dialogue on music forums [Facebook], kind of attacking the value of the music scene here...”

“I felt like we needed something positive to put that energy into.”

“So that’s kind of the punch behind it all, just to champion something for musicians to get behind”

The result is an event with approximately 32 acts, taking place over two sessions: an afternoon in St Paul's Cathedral and an evening in Starters Bar. It’s honestly huge, and the lineup was specifically curated to offer as much diversity as possible.

“I’ve got punk rock, acoustic stuff, electronic, some uni bands, hip-hop…”

“I’ve got Calla, she’s something else, what she does is kind of like ethereal almost like gregorian chant style electronic stuff. So that’s going to be something different...”

“Smol Terf Syndrome, they are going to be doing like an electronic live thing. Trumpets, drumpads, all sorts of stuff...”

“Marissa and the Dandelions they’re the loud as fuck band in Dunedin who got shut down by noise control [and sparked the ‘Save Dunedin Live Music’ petition]...”

“So it’s stacked as much as I can, and as diverse as I can be.”

Part of the goal was also to make sure musicians get paid, and all of the door take will be split evenly across all personnel. As such, Person Will has done everything he can to keep costs down, from creating all the promotional material, to even making his own booking website and ticketing system.

“I’ve just done everything in the community with people supporting me. WEKA’s been really supportive, Wellness Empathy Kindness Aotearoa, it’s a charity organization just for promoting wellbeing in society, they’re huge for social development.”

“WEKA, Strawberry Sound and Save Dunedin Live Music, they’ve been the biggest supporters, and of course Starters as well.”

Starters Bar stepped up when the previously arranged venue (New New New) abruptly cancelled at the last minute, effectively saving the event.

“Getting 32 bands to commit [is] not easy, especially when the venue pulls out and the date changes, it’s a logistical nightmare.”

“All sorts of drama just to get it over the line.”

It’s a true community event, and to me it feels like a rejection of the cold commercial rhetoric advocated by some. People will happily do stuff, without considering how much profit it would bring to themselves or stakeholders, just because if they didn’t, it wouldn’t happen.

“Everyone should come because there’s so much for everyone.”

“[It’s] an eclectic lineup that flows nicely and gives someone something that they really enjoy and expect, usually after something that they might enjoy and not expect, and vice versa.”
