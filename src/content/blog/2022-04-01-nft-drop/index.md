The upcoming dunedinsound.com NFT collection comprises of 15,472 images, and 859 audio bootlegs. Each item is unique, but together they form a novel snapshot into 8 years of Dunedin's musical lineage. Collect them all, or just your favorites!

NFTs are collectible digital assets. Ownership is guaranteed by secure blockchain technology, and unlike most digital content, they're truly ownable, and you are free to do anything you want with them, including resell them. Once you own an NFT, nobody (not even the creator) can take that right away from you.
