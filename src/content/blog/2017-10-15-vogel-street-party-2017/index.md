Vogel Street Party happened again this year for the third time. Families, students alike (but mostly families) all flocked to the old warehouse precinct to experience music, art, food and more.

A sudden thunderstorm hit at around 6:30pm and scared away the weak, but the true Vogel Street Partiers didn't mind hanging out under cover until the weather subsided, or had anticipated meteorological upset and brought umbrellas.

Check out the gig page <a title="Vogel Street Party 2017" href="/gigs/vogel-street-party-2017/">here</a> for photos and videos of some of the bands who played.

And here's the rest of the media from the event (93 photos and one video)
