In 2011 Lee Nicolson started making guitar pedals. He learnt how to breadboard from a friend, a rudimentary prototyping method which involves poking wires through little holes to build up a circuit. Then he moved onto ironing copper onto printed circuit boards.

Seven years later heâ€™s manufacturing pedals which are distributed worldwide, and selling them to the likes of Ryan Adams and Jason Derulo producer Ricky Reed, all without any marketing or outside investment.

I caught up with him to find out how it's going and why there's so much buzz around his pedals.
