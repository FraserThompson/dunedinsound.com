## Do you have media from a local gig?

If you have photos, audio, or videos from local gigs which aren't on the website we'd love to add them, just as long as they comply with these guidelines:

- Media should preferably document an entire gig, not just one band (although there are some exceptions to this rule)
- Photos should be reasonably high quality, this probably does mean (but doesn't necessarily have to mean) they were taken on a DSLR or equivalent
- Same goes for video. Also if you have video it's extremely preferable that it's either full songs or the full set
- Audio should sound quite a lot like it did live, not just vaguely reminiscent. As long as it's not a distorted garbled mess and you can hear what they're doing its probably ok
- By submitting your media you're putting it into the public domain and people might take it, hopefully they'll credit you but they might not (we don't do watermarks)

If you're not sure send it through anyway and we'll go from there. Since this whole thing is completely negative profit you won't be paid but you'll be credited on the site if accepted.
