## What is this?

The aim of dunedinsound.com is to document a vertical slice of the current music scene in Dunedin as it happens.

Most of that is done by going to gigs, documenting them via photo, video and audio, then archiving them here.

<a title="Dunedin Sound on Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin_sound" target="_blank">The Dunedin Sound</a> is often described as a movement from the past. This site is a reminder that great music never stopped coming out of Dunedin.

## Are you making money?

dunedinsound.com is completely non-commercial, no sponsors, no ads, no money. The intent is to support the music community and not take anything from it. The current cost of hosting everything is around **\$10** a month.

All works are licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a> meaning you can do whatever you want as long as you mention dunedinsound.com and you're not making loads of money off of it (contact fraser@dunedinsound.com if you want to use it commercially).

I'm not affiliated with any venue or band so consider my audio recordings bootlegs.

## Why not just put stuff on Facebook like everyone else?

Facebook is terrible for archiving.

- It's not indexed by Google or other search engines
- Finding anything is a chore because it's more interested in making money off you than helping you find what you want
- For photos specifically, the image compression is very aggressive and makes your photos look bad

"Anything you put online is there forever" is a common misconception - if you're posting content on someone elses platform there's no gaurantee it will be there tomorrow.

dunedinsound.com is a permanent archive, artists/fans will be able to access it decades from now, and it should be pretty easy to use and find what they're after.

## What equipment do you use?

In case you're curious.

- Custom binaural headset: Two electret microphones, modified to withstand higher volumes without distorting, shoved into a pair of earplugs, and wired up to a battery box. They go in my ears and record sound with the added benefit of protecting my hearing somewhat. This is how I get decent sounding recordings without setting anything up or talking to the sound person.
- Panasonic G85 micro four-thirds camera with vintage M42 mount lenses, usually an Asahi Pentax 50mm 1.4 (the one with the radioactive element).
- Panasonic GX850 as a b-cam for multi-angle video.
- Roland R-05 portable recorder. Built in mics are okay as a backup.

My recording rig is wearable, so I can just stand in the audience and get a pretty good recording. Also, unlike a recording from the soundboard my recordings capture exactly what it sounded like from the audience, which can be really good or really bad or anywhere in between.

Most of the recordings are [binaural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording) so that means they'll sound best on headphones.

## I've got something to say!

Want uncompressed images? Help yourself, there's download button at the top right after opening an image. Maybe you want copies of videos though? Or want me to come to your gig? Or something else? You can contact me here: <a href="mailto:fraser@dunedinsound.com">fraser@dunedinsound.com</a>
