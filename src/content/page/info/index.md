What is this?
--------------------------
The aim of dunedinsound.com is to document a slice of the current music scene in Dunedin as it happens.

Part of that involves going to gigs, documenting them via photo, video and audio, then archiving them here.

I'm not affiliated with any venue or band so consider my recordings bootlegs.

Are you making money?
------------------------------
dunedinsound.com is completely non-commercial, no sponsors, no ads, no money. The intent is to support the music community and not take anything from it.

Why not just put stuff on Facebook like everyone else?
--------------------------
I don't think Facebook is designed for long term storage, and I also don't think the user experience is very good for this sort of thing.

dunedinsound.com is meant to be a more permanent archive, the goal is that artists/fans will be able to access it decades from now.

What equipment do you use?
---------------------------
* Panasonic G85 micro four-thirds camera with vintage M42 mount lenses, usually an Asahi Pentax 50mm 1.4 (the one with the radioactive element).
* Panasonic G6 as a b-cam for multi-angle video.
* Custom binaural headset: Two electret microphones shoved into a pair of earplugs and wired up to a battery box. They go in my ears.
* Roland R-05 portable recorder. Built in mics are okay as a backup.

My recording rig is wearable, which means I can stand in the audience and get a pretty good recording without any setup required. Also unlike a recording from the soundboard my recordings capture exactly what it sounded like from the audience. 

The downside is not every element will be clear like a studio recording. Most of the recordings are [binaural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording) so that means they'll sound best on headphones.

I've got something to say!
